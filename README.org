#+Title: Mettaton

A collection of my widgets and animated background built with HTML, CSS and JS.

** How to use
   All those static elements are hosted on the amazing netlify. You can access them all to https://tv.juanwolf.fr.

   Import them as "Browser source" on OBS and apply a custom CSS to it so it can match your style.

** Contribute
   Feel free! You know the drill, fork, open a MR and I'll review it.
